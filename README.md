## Description

In this game for two, the goal is to reach twenty points by randomly rolling the dice. The first player to reach twenty or more points wins. Every time the playing player gets number one, the points are reset, and the other player starts to play. As long as the player wants to keep the points, he can do so by pressing the HOLD button. After that, those points are saved for him and the other player starts playing. At every moment of the game, there is a possibility to start a new game, where all points are reset.
